By closely coupling \tcp and \tls, \tcpls builds upon two of the most important
end-to-end protocols. Given the huge activity on these two protocols within the
research community and the IETF, we restrict our discussion to the closest
related works. Several survey papers provide additional context information
\cite{polese2019survey,li2016multipath,papastergiou2016ossifying}.

Given its security features, \tcpls must be compared with \tcpcrypt
\cite{bittau2010case,rfc8548}. \tcpcrypt predates \tls 1.3. It uses TCP options
to support opportunistic encryption but is not secure against an active network
attacker. \tcpls is compatible with \tls, retains its security properties and supports
additional features. It is also compatible with \tcp middleboxes.

\tcpls also needs to be compared with \mptcp \cite{raiciu2012hard,rfc6824}.
\mptcp supports several coupled congestion control schemes
\cite{peng2014multipath,wischik2011design,khalili2013mptcp} that preserve
fairness even when different paths share the same bottleneck. These are not yet
included in our \tcpls prototype, but could be added with some engineering
effort. The initial idea of coupling \mptcp and \tls was proposed in an expired
Internet draft \cite{draft-paasch-mptcp-ssl-00}, but it was not adopted by the
IETF. MPTCPSec \cite{jadin2017securing} adds security capabilities to \mptcp but
comes with a large performance penalty.

Another important related work is \quic. The initial design
\cite{roskind2013quic} has evolved a lot and large companies have started to
adopt it \cite{langley2017quic,Joras_mvfst,marx2020same}. The \quic
version 1 specification \cite{draft-ietf-quic-transport} supports connection
migration like \tcpls, but we could not test it in our lab since none of the
available open-source implementations have yet implemented it. Multipath
extensions
\cite{viernickel2018multipath,de2017multipath,draft-deconinck-quic-multipath-06,draft-liu-multipath-quic-02}
to \quic have been discussed but not yet adopted within the IETF. Finally, PQUIC
\cite{de2019pluginizing} proposed to carry eBPF code over \quic connections to
deploy new protocol features. This goes beyond the exchange of congestion
control scheme that we demonstrated with \tcpls.

Finally, several solutions have been proposed to provide multipath capabilities
in the application layer. Examples include MP-H2 \cite{nikravesh2019mp} that
extends HTTP/2, MP-DASH \cite{han2016mp} for video streaming or mHTTP
\cite{kim2014multi} that extends HTTP.


\tcpls's idea has also similarities with TLS FOP~\cite{sy2020enhanced}, a
proposal to solve the privacy issue with TFO. However, \tcpls is more generic,
and shows how we can achieve such extensibility work for any other concerns and
new features.

%% Several researchers have proposed techniques to extend various transport
%% protocols. The IETF provides generic guidelines on the design of
%% protocol extensions \cite{rfc6709}. Several researchers have proposed
%% solutions to simplify the implementation of extensions to transport
%% protocols. The closest example include STP \cite{patel2003upgrading}, CTP
%% \cite{bridges2007configurable} and 

%% Patel et al. \cite{patel2003upgrading} propose to use a type-safe version of C to extend a TCP
%% implementation by using bytecode. The implementation of TCPLS completely differs since it uses C to generate eBPF code. Furthemore, by leveraging the
%% flexibility of TLS, TCPLS can securrely exchange various options over a
%% connection. Bridges et al.
%% In CTP, Bridges et al. propose a new protocol that is composed of different microprotocols which can be combined together. In PQUIC, De Coninck et al. \cite{de2019pluginizing} include an eBPF virtual machine inside a QUIC implementation to extend it by using protocol plugins. Our approach is similar from an implementation viewpoint. By combining the TLS and TCP layers, we bring more extensibility to TCP.

%% A wide range of TCP extensions have been proposed \cite{rfc7414}. Some tune
%% protocol implementations with new strategies to retransmit lost data,
%% compute retransmission timers or manage congestion. These do not require
%% the definition of new TCP options that are negotiated during the handshake.
%% Some TCP extensions require the definition of new TCP options. These
%% include the timestamp and large windows extension \cite{rfc7313},
%% the support for selective acknowledgements \cite{rfc2018}, TCP Fast Open
%% \cite{rfc7413} or Multipath TCP \cite{rfc6824}. These extensions are negotiated
%% by exchanging TCP options during the connection handshake. These TCP options
%% allow to extend TCP, but they suffer from several limitations. First,
%% there is limited space in the TCP header to carry them. This limits the
%% number of extensions that can be used for a given TCP connection. The IETF
%% discusses solutions to extend the TCP header space, but the solution is neither
%% finalized nor implemented \cite{draft-ietf-tcpm-tcp-edo-10}. Second, middleboxes
%% interfere with the utilization of new options \cite{honda2011still}. This
%% interference severely limits the extensibility of TCP. TCPLS does not suffer
%% from these problems since the options that it carries are encrypted and can
%% span an entire TLS record (16KBytes).
