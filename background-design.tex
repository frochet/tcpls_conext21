The slow pace of innovation in \tcp-based transport services can be explained by  several factors. First, the amount of bytes for extensions in the \tcp header is limited to 40 bytes. Second, it is exchanged in cleartext and is known to have heavily ossified due to middleboxes, strongly restraining changes in the header semantics, and to \tcp \texttt{Options}. Third, \tcp is often implemented in the kernel,  which adds complexity to implement and deploy any modification. Following the recent advances in the transport layer, we go back to {\small{\textit{RQ1}}} and ask \textit{Can TCP and TLS be combined to address these issues}?

Our answer to {\small{\textit{RQ1}}} is fully positive. Indeed, by leveraging the flexible encrypted \tls records, we can supplement the \tls-encrypted application data with transport-level control data allowing \tcpls to provide a large range of new transport services. In addition, existing \tcp \texttt{Options} can be securely conveyed in new \tls records. %and new transport services can be built

%est effectivement parfois embrouillante

In this section, we explain how we combine \tcp and \tls into \tcpls. In particular, We first introduce the \tcpls records which are the basic unit of communication in \tcpls (Sec.~\ref{design.records}).  We next explain how a \tcpls connection starts (Sec.~\ref{design.start}). We finally show
how \tcpls uses them to provide modern transport services (sec.~\ref{sec:transport-services}) such as multiplexing, connection migration, and a novel multipath approach, answering so to {\small{\textit{RQ2}}} (\textit{What are the new transport services this combination can offer?}).  Finally, we explain how to close a \tcpls connection (Sec.~\ref{design.closing}).


\subsection{\tls Records and Extensions}\label{design.records}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Today's applications expect more than a simple bytestream from the transport
%layer. Security is not anymore a requirement for niche application. Applications
%expect secure transport by default. Similarly, applications are not restricted
%anymore on using only one network interface. They need to efficiently deal with
%IPv6 and IPv4 on dual stack hosts and manage the utilization of different
%network interfaces on mobile devices such as smartphones.
%\tcpls provides a
%fast, flexible, and secure transport protocol that is suited for these modern
%applications.

\end{figure}

Each protocol has a basic unit for exchanging application and control data.
For instance, \tcp segments are split in two with only the header dedicated to control data. In \quic, the basic unit is a \quic packet which can carry several and different types of \quic frames. \tls supports \tls records of different types and lengths.  As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:tls-tcpls-records}, \tcpls leverages the \tls encrypted records that hide from middleboxes their true type and content in opaque \texttt{AppData} records. In this way, \tcpls can extend the messages exchanged with \tls in a secure and flexible manner.
%Some \tcpls control information may sometimes be packaged
%within a record containing Application Data, such as a sequence number for
%bandwidth aggregation.

%\todo{Is the following enough regarding Olivier email?}
We chose to design the \tcpls framing at the \tls record level so that
encryption and decryption operations can be performed atomically and with
a zero-copy codepath. Indeed, any \tcpls control information that is not relevant to the application is
%always encrypted and
located at the end of the record so that, by adjusting the offset when
decrypting the \tcpls records, the receiver can overwrite them and achieve a zero-copy codepath.
% for performance reasons: it
%guarantees the
%availability
%of a zero-copy codepath after decryption.
%(mp) implementation: -> section 4
%In our implementation, a contiguous
%zero-copy to the receiver is made possible thanks to this careful protocol
%consideration.

%(mp): TODO To discuss when comparing to QUIC IMO
%Note that in contrast, \quic only supports encrypting to the size of the \quic
%packet. Moreover, the fact that DATA frames can be sandwitched within control
%frames
%prevents a contiguous memory blob to be given to the application in zero-copy.
%Assuming everything else being equal, these facts lower the expected
%performance
%and make the design of the API more challenging for a \quic implementation,
%requiring multiple pointers and sizes to be passed to the application to
%efficiently read the decrypted data.

\tls also offers a mean for requesting extended functionalities in a \tls
session through request/response messages called \tls \texttt{Encrypted}
\texttt{Extensions}.
%They are exchanged during
%the \tls handshake with some security guaranteesa. \todo{state them briefly}
\tcpls extends these messages to negotiate during the handshake some of the new
transport services it offers.

\tcpls leverages these records and extensions to exchange \tcp \texttt{Options}. They can be negotiated at the start of the connection using \tls extensions and exchanged later throughout the connection in \tcpls encrypted control records. Since \tls messages are conveyed in the \tcp payload, they are not space-constrained as existing \tcp options.
They are also exchanged reliably, which is a requirement of many \tcp \texttt{Options} including \tcp User Timeout option~\cite{rfc5482}, \mptcp's \texttt{ADD\_ADDR} and \texttt{REMOVE\_ADDR} option and some experimental \tcp options~\cite{rfc6994}. They also cannot be modified by middleboxes as they are secured by \tls. However, \tcp proxies could prevent an end-to-end \tcp connection, in which case this mechanism should not be used. Detecting \tcp proxies is easy as one could echo a part of the \tcp header in a \tcpls record to detect them.

%\todo{Detecting proxies arrive de façon un peu bizarre. (mp): Mieux
%maintenant? On peut le bouger ailleurs sinon}

\subsection{Starting a \tcpls Connection}\label{design.start}

A \tcpls connection starts with a \tcp handshake followed by a \tls handshake.
This process can be safely accelerated through the use of \tcp Fast Open~\cite{rfc7413}.
%\tls 1.3~\cite{rfc8446} has been designed with careful consideration for
%potential extensions and to prevent middlebox interference.
A \tcpls client
indicates its willingness to use \tcpls with the \tcpls \texttt{Hello} extension
in its \tls \textsc{ClientHello} message. Upon reception of this extension, the \tcpls server replies with a \tls \textsc{ServerHello} message echoing the \tcpls \texttt{Hello} extension in \tls \textsc{EncryptedExtensions}.
%It can opportunistically add
%lightweight \tcpls data and \tcp options as \textsc{EncryptedExtensions}.
These are encrypted with the handshake key which is not part of the context used to derive the eventual application key.
%If the client does not support some extension, it echoes back
%an alert with the value of the option it does not recognize, letting the connection
%continues.
Once the \tls handshake has succeeded, the endpoints can exchange \tcpls
records.

Our design ensures that middleboxes cannot distinguish \tcpls from \tls past the handshake. This eases the \tcpls deployment and hardens censorship attempts. Whenever a middlebox blocks the client \tcpls's handshake extensions, the later could choose to enable \tcpls after the handshake using \tcpls control records, provided that the server announced \tcpls support.
The censor would not be able to trivially distinguish this behaviour from regular \tls, hardening potential attempts for censoring applications using \tcpls. The server handshake extensions are encrypted and thus cannot be targeted by such attacks.

\todo{FR: I am not sure this is correct.  EncryptedExtensions could be dropped
  by a middlebox, yet the TLS app-key should still be properly derived, and the
  client cannot know whether the server supports TCPLS}

%\todo{Is the following best here? -> Background ?}
%A reasonable approach to design extensibility mechanisms in the Internet
%is to avoid leaking any information that could help an on-path attacker
%recognize specific users or applications. Indeed, censorship~\cite{Morshed2017a,
%	Gosain2017a,Chai2019a} can be easily implemented when protocol messages can be
%distinguished. Researchers advocates that avoiding trivial opportunities to
%implement censorship should become the bare minimum in designing a new protocol.
%\tcpls%'s control protocol
%considers these problems by restricting the use of
%plaintext extensions data in the \textsc{ClientHello} as much as possible.


%To prevent middlebox interference, the \tls 1.3 Record Protocol ensures that any
%new message appears as an \textsc{AppData} message type. \tls stores the true
%content type (TType) at the end of the encrypted payload. \tcpls uses this
%feature of \tls 1.3 to encode the control messages that are sent over the secure
%channel as new \tls record types.

%\tcpls is more than the simple addition of the security features
%of \tls and the reliability features of \tcp. \tcpls leverages \tls 1.3 to
%negotiate a security context and uses it to send the user data authenticated and
%encrypted as \tls records. These records create a secure
%control channel between the client and server. This channel is used to manage
%the \tcpls session and exchange all control information without any possible
%middlebox interference. \tcpls includes a Connection Manager (CM) that
%controls the underlying \tcp connections. The \tls records of a \tcpls session can
%be transported over different \tcp connections during the session lifetime. This
%brings several interesting failover and multipath capabilities.
%Fig.~\ref{fig:arch} illustrates the interactions between two \tcpls hosts.
%\tcpls can be implemented in userspace within a library like current \tls
%implementations. It interacts with the \tcp stack that in our prototype resides
%in the kernel. The crypto module negotiates and manages the security context
%while the CM manages the utilization of the underlying \tcp connection(s).
%Closely coupling \tcp and \tls in \tcpls brings opportunities for performance improvement (e.g., avoiding records fragmentation with dynamic receive buffer auto-tuning and/or with dynamic control of the record length), and for connection reliability (e.g., failover).

%\tcp separates control information and data by placing the control information
%in the packet header and the data in the payload. This separation worked well
%until middleboxes started to interfere with \tcp~\cite{10.1145/1064413.1064418,
%  honda2011still}. On a fraction of Internet paths, including e.g., some
%enterprise and cellular networks, some middleboxes interfere by adding,
%removing, or changing \tcp
%options~\cite{wang2011untold,honda2011still,xu2015investigating} and, in some
%cases, also transparently terminating \tcp connections.
%
%%These middleboxes have
%%slowed down the evolution of \tcp in recent years.
%
%\tcpls also uses the packet
%header to exchange \tcp control information, but it leverages the extensibility
%of \tls 1.3 to place control information including some \tcp options inside the
%\tls handshake messages and new \tls records. Since this information is
%encrypted and authenticated, the communicating hosts can exchange new control
%information without encountering middlebox interference. We refer to this
%exchange of control information as the \textit{secure channel} between the two hosts.
%
%A \tcpls session starts with a secure \tls 1.3 handshake~\cite{rfc8446}. The
%client adds a new \tcpls transport parameter in its \textsc{ClientHello}
%message. A \tcpls server replies with a \textsc{ServerHello} message that
%negotiates the security keys and may include additional \tcpls information as
%\textsc{EncryptedExtensions}. After this secure handshake, the client and the
%server have a shared security context.
%
%As \sctp~\cite{rfc4960} or \quic~\cite{draft-ietf-quic-transport}, \tcpls
%supports one or more streams over a single \tcpls session. An application can
%open, attach, and close streams to an existing \tcpls session. Each stream is an
%independent cryptographic context derived from the \tcpls security context. The
%\tcpls streams can carry application data or control information.
%Streams are attached over the Secure Control Channel. Since each stream is an
%independent cryptographic context, the recipient can immediately start to
%decrypt and extract data from the new stream. No round-trip is wasted to attach
%a new stream.
%
%\tcpls' CM controls the utilization of the underlying \tcp connections. It can open, close, or reestablish failed \tcp connections. Each of the connections that composes a \tcpls session is identified by a \emph{transport identifier}. By default, the data from a stream can be sent over any of the underlying \tcp connections. The applications that require finer control over the utilization of the underlying \tcp connections can use the \tcpls API to map a stream on a specific underlying connection. In this case, all the data of this stream is exchanged over this specific connection. By placing two streams on different connections, an application can prevent Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking among these streams.
%
%\tcpls also supports failover and multipath. To support these features, data
%from a given stream is sent over different \tcp connections. In
%this case, the \tcp level sequence numbers and acknowledgements are not
%sufficient anymore to enable the receiver to reorder the data and \tcpls
%adds its own sequence numbers and acknowledgements that are exchanged as
%new \tls records over the secure control channel. Thanks to these \tcpls acknowledegments, a \tcpls session can survive to the failure of an underlying \tcp connection by reestablishing a new \tcp connection to continue the data transfer and replaying the lost records.
%
%A \tcp connection ends with the exchange of \fin or \rst packets. However, some
%middleboxes force the termination of \tcp connections by sending \rst
%packets~\cite{rfc3360,weaver2009detecting}. \tcpls can preserve established
%session by automatically restarting the underlying \tcp connection upon
%reception of a spurious reset. \tcpls defines the connection termination at the
%stream level: a \tcp connection is closed once the last stream attached to a
%\tcp connection is securely closed.

%In summary, \tcpls provides a flexible abstraction to the
%upper layer that supports various new features such as streams, connection
%reliability, different secure multipath modes, secure connection closing,
%encrypted \tcp options, and leverages \tcp's performance and \tls's state of
%deployment.
