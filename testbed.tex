% testbed description
We deploy a testbed composed of three machines with Intel Xeon CPU E5-2630
2.40GHz, 16 Threads, at least 16GB RAM, running Debian with 5.7 and
5.9 kernels. Two of these machines play the role of Client and Server,
while one is the Middlebox (MB). Each machine is equipped with an
Intel XL710 2x40GB NIC, directly connected as shown in Fig.~\fig{testbed}.
Traffic exchanged by C and S has to go through MB first. Each device is
configured to maximize its performances, with a single TCP connection
reaching 22 Gbps with a 1500 Bytes MTU and linerate (i.e., 40 Gbps) when
using jumbo frames.
