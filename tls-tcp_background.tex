\tcp~\cite{rfc793} enables a client and a server to exchange data
over a connection that exposes a bidirectional reliable bytestream.
Dozens of \tcp extensions have been standardised and implemented~\cite{RFC7414} while still preserving the same packet format. Most of these extensions rely on \tcp options whose usage is negotiated during the three-way handshake.

%The measurement studies carried out during the last decades, see,
%e.g.,~ \cite{paxson1994growth,claffy1993traffic,maier2009dominant,trevisan2020five},
%have shown that \tcp was by far the most widely used protocols. It is only
%recently that measurement studies have shown a growth in \udp
%traffic~\cite{trevisan2020five}.

\tcp was designed as an end-to-end protocol that is only used on endhosts.
Despite this architectural principle, network operators have deployed a variety
of middleboxes (e.g., firewalls, NATs, transparent proxies)~\cite{mCloud} that
sometimes interfere with \tcp or its extensions~\cite{medina2004measuring,
honda2011still, edeline2019bottom}. These in-path network functions make
assumptions about the content of \tcp packets, invalidating the initial
end-to-end paradigm of \tcp. Moreover, they do not always strictly follow the
\tcp specifications~\cite{honda2011still, hesmans2013tcp}, which may negatively
affect \tcp evolution and performances~\cite{edeline2020evaluating}.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, \tcp was mainly used directly by applications such
as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, telnet,~\ldots However, when an application exchanges
plaintext using \tcp, it exposes its users to various privacy problems and
attacks. Initially, only banks and e-commerce websites considered the usage of
plaintext to be problematic and used cryptographic techniques to encrypt and
authenticate the information exchanged using Secure Socket Layer
(SSL)~\cite{draft-hickman-netscape-ssl}. At that time, using SSL was costly from
a performance viewpoint. During the last two decades, the situation completly
changed. Modern CPUs include specialised instructions that enable fast
encryption. Furthermore, the SSL standardisation improved the protocol security.
The most recent version (\tls 1.3~\cite{rfc8446}) is considered to be much more
secure than the previous ones and Let's Encrypt~\cite{aas2019let} has
simplified the distribution of certificates.

%Transport Layer Security (\tls) is on
%90\% of the Alexa top 1M websites~\cite{holz2019era,holz2020tracking} and many
%other applications also rely on \tls~\cite{anderson2019tls}. More importantly,
%modern applications require both the reliability provided by \tcp and the
%security provided by \tls.

\tls 1.3 brings several important features compared to the previous versions. It
includes a secure handshake that allows to negotiate the security parameters and
keys within one round-trip-time. Thanks to \tcp Fast Open
\cite{radhakrishnan2011tcp}, it is also possible to perform the secure handshake
during the \tcp handshake. Furthermore, it is possible to also exchange
application data during the handshake. The \tls 1.3 record layer protects all
application data with encryption and authentication. This record layer is
extensible and to prevent ossification, the \tls record types are also
encrypted.

During the last five years, the IETF has put a lot of effort
in designing and deploying a new transport protocol targeted at web
applications: \quic \cite{langley2017quic}. \quic provides a secure and
reliable delivery like the traditional \tls/\tcp stack, but on top of \udp.
%This
%choice was motivated by two design requirements. First, \quic must be able to go
%through middleboxes and most of the deployed ones only support \tcp and \udp.
%Second, it must be possible to implement \quic as a userspace library.
\quic
version 1.0 is being finalised~\cite{draft-ietf-quic-transport} and there are
more than a dozen implementations~\cite{quicimplem,marx2020same}. \quic is used
in production as shown by recent measurement studies~\cite{trevisan2020five}.

In addition to reliable and secure delivery, a growing number of applications
are used on devices such as smartphones that are attached to two or more
networks. Users expect their applications to be resilient to network failures.
With regular \tcp, applications need to reestablish their connections when one
of their network connection fails. Multipath \tcp
(\mptcp)~\cite{rfc8684,raiciu2012hard} is a \tcp extension that enables a
connection to use different paths. One of the main use cases for \mptcp is to
provide fast failovers on iPhones~\cite{bonaventure2016multipath}. It also
provides bandwidth aggregation by simultaneously using two or more network paths
to support one connection. Multipath extensions have also been proposed for
\quic~\cite{viernickel2018multipath,de2017multipath}. \quic version
1.0~\cite{draft-ietf-quic-transport} includes a connection migration capability
that supports failovers but not bandwidth aggregation.
