The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) \cite{rfc793} is the most
popular Internet transport protocol. It enables a client and a server
to exchange data over a connection that exposes a bidirectional
reliable bytestream. 
TCP has evolved a lot since the publication of
the first specification while still preserving the same packet
format. Dozens of TCP extensions have been standardised and
implemented \cite{RFC7414}. Several of these extensions rely on TCP
options and are negotiated during the three-way handshake.

The measurement studies carried out during the last decades, see
e.g. \cite{paxson1994growth,claffy1993traffic,maier2009dominant,trevisan2020five},
have shown that TCP was by far the most widely used protocols. It is
only recently that measurement studies have shown a growth in UDP
traffic \cite{trevisan2020five}.

TCP was designed as an end-to-end protocol that is only used on
endhosts. Despite this architectural principale, network operators
have deployed a variety of middleboxes (firewalls, NAT, transparent
proxies, \ldots) that sometimes interfere with TCP or its extensions
\cite{medina2004measuring, honda2011still, edeline2017first}.
These middleboxes make some assumptions about the content of TCP
packets and do not always complete follow the TCP specifications
\cite{honda2011still, hesmans2013tcp}.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, TCP was mainly used directly by
applications such as HTTP, SMTP, FTP, telnet, ssh, \ldots However,
when an application exchanges plaintext using TCP, it exposes its
users to various privacy problems and attacks. Initially, only banks
and e-commerce websites considered the usage of plaintext to be
problematic and used cryptographic techniques to encrypt and
authenticate the information exchanged using Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
\cite{draft-hickman-netscape-ssl}. At that time, using SSL was costly
from a performance viewpoint. During the last two decades, the
situation completed changed. Modern CPUs include specialised
instructions that enable fast encryption. Furthermore, the
standardisation of SSL improved the security of the protocol. The most
recent version (TLS 1.3 \cite{rfc8446}) is considered to be much more
secure than the previous ones. Furthermore, Let's Encrypt
\cite{aas2019let} has simplified the distribution of
certificates. 
Transport Layer Security (TLS) is on 90\% of the Alexa
top 1M websites \cite{holz2019era,holz2020tracking} and many other applications also
rely on TLS  \cite{anderson2019tls}. 
More importantly, modern applications
require \textbf{both} the reliability provided by TCP and the security provided
by TLS. 

TLS 1.3 brings several important features compared to the previous
versions. It includes a secure handshake that allows to negotiate the
security parameters and keys within one round-trip-time. Thanks to
TCP Fast Open \cite{radhakrishnan2011tcp}, it is possible to perform
the secure handshake during the TCP handshake. Furthermore, it is
possible to also exchange application data during the handshake.
The TLS 1.3 record layer protects all application data with encryption and
authentication. This record layer is extensible and to prevent
ossification, TLS record types are also encrypted.

During the last five years, cloud vendors and the IETF have put a lot
of effort in designing and deploying a new transport protocol targeted
at web applications: QUIC \cite{10.1145/3098822.3098842}. QUIC
provides a secure and reliable delivery like the traditional TLS/TCP
stack, but on top of UDP. This choice was motivated by two design
requirements. First, QUIC must be able to go through middleboxes and most
of the deployed ones only support TCP and UDP. Second, it must be
possible to implement QUIC as a userspace library. The version 1.0 of
QUIC is being finalised \cite{draft-ietf-quic-transport} and there are
more than a dozen implementations \cite{quicimplem,marx2020same}. QUIC is used in
production as shown by recent measurement studies \cite{trevisan2020five}.

In addition to reliable and secure delivery, a growing number of
applications are used on devices such as smartphones that are attached
to two or more networks. Users expect their applications to be
resilient to network failures. With regular TCP, applications need to
reestablish their connections when one of their network connection
fails. Multipath TCP \cite{rfc8684,raiciu2012hard} is a TCP extension
that enables a connection to use different paths. One of the main use
cases for Multipath TCP is to provide fast failovers on iPhones
\cite{bonaventure2016multipath}. It also provides bandwidth
aggregation by simultaneously using two or more network paths to
support one connection. Multipath extensions have also been proposed
for QUIC \cite{viernickel2018multipath,de2017multipath}. QUIC version
1.0 \cite{draft-ietf-quic-transport} includes a connection migration
capability that supports failovers but not bandwidth aggregation.
